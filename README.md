Inkscape is professional quality vector graphics software which runs on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. It is used by design professionals and hobbyists worldwide, for creating a wide variety of graphics such as illustrations, icons, logos, diagrams, maps and web graphics. Inkscape uses the [W3C](http://www.w3.org) open standard [SVG](http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/) (Scalable Vector Graphics) as its native format, and is free and open-source software.
